# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
Using JavaScript's D3 and Leaflet libraries, the Mapbox API, and geoJSON data (from the USGS website) to create an interactive map that displays earthquake data from the last seven days as well as showing tectonic plate boundaries.

The D3.js library is used to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. The Leaflet library is used to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
